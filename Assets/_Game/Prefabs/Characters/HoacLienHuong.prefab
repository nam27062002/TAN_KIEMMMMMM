    story: "In the country of Nguy\u1EC7t Minh (lit: Moonbright), troupes and performers
      are treated like a subhuman class, not worthy of being classified as the four
      types of citizens. This was the result of a decree by an emperor several hundreds
      years ago, in which he ordered the Ministry of Finance to compile a list of
      all singers, actors, and street performers in the country. People whose names
      were on this Performers List not only had to pay twice as high personal taxes
      as ordinary people, but also suffered from all kinnds of restrictions. For
      example, they\u2019re required to have a certificate issued by the government
      connfirming that their freedom have been paid for to even be allowed to change
      professions, or buy any lands or properties. And whenever there are needs for
      venturing into unexplored lands or fighting invaders at the borders, these
      people were also priorized for mandatory recruitments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty years
      ago, Emperor Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng issued another decree called \u201CAssociation
      by three generation\u201D; which essentially said that any children or grandchildren
      of performers and prostitutes were also included in the Performers List by
      default. This further solidified the social status of performers as lowest
      of the low, rock bottom, worse than cattle, even.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, in life,
      there\u2019d always be exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in Thi\xEAn \u0110\xF4 Citadel,
      where the Ministry of Finance enforced the \u201CAssociation by three generations\u201D
      decree most strictly, there was a special case, a Brothel called Ki\u1EBFn
      Long House. From the local officials to gangs around the area, no one would
      dare to provoke the Madame of this place (Ki\u1EBFn Long literally means \u201Cmeeting
      dragon\u201D, elluding to the fact even the Emperor would visit this place
      from time to time).\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years passed, Ki\u1EBFn Long House would
      take in street performers and wandering entertainers of all kinds from all
      over the country, and in no time, it had hundreds of famous performers. Every
      day, all kinds of people with different backgrounds, social statuses, and professions
      would pass through the vermilion door of the House, to drink and be entertained.
      As the wine poured in and the words poured out, it didn\u2019t take long before
      the Madame of Ki\u1EBFn Long House became the most well-informed person in
      Thi\xEAn \u0110\xF4 Citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding this fact, the Madame of
      the House was not at all afraid. On the contrary, she was overjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers
      would perhaps worry about knowing too much, and getting eliminated who knows
      when as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Madame of Ki\u1EBFn Long House, however, was
      different.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly by becoming a \u201Ckhow-it-all\u201D in Thi\xEAn
      \u0110\xF4 Citadel could she complete the missions assigned to her by her organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
      Madame of Ki\u1EBFn Long House \u2013 Ho\u1EAFc Li\xEAn H\u01B0\u01A1ng \u2013
      had, in fact, another identity. She was the leader of the Wind Sect of the
      Vong Organization, in charge of gathering intelligence on behalf of the organization.
      Her position is only below that of Commander L\xFD V\xF4 Danh"
