    story: "There\u2019s this saying, an innocent man can become guilty for carrying
      precious gems. The \u0110o\xE0n family\u2019s wealth turned them into a thorn
      in the eyes of many. Those who had less were envious of them, and those who
      had more were wary of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd thus, The Venomous Yaksha is the
      sharp dagger that the \u0110o\xE0n Clan used, both to defend themselves, and
      to destroy their enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old street performers and storytellers
      would often tell each other myths and legends about her.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the
      rumor went, The Venomous Yaksha was as light as a swallow, she could climb
      over walls and cliffs as if walking on flat ground. No matter how high the
      wall of a private residence were, she could always break in.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
      Venomous Yaksha wore a small bell on her wrist, so every time she moved or
      jumped, it would rang out in a high-pitched sound. Yet, even if her victims
      had dozens of highly skilled martial artists for bodyguards and a pack of hunting
      dogs with sharp eyes and ears, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. In the end,
      when the dawn\u2019s first ray of sunlight shone into one of her targets\u2019
      room, it would be greeted by a stiff, cold corpse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were also
      stories that said The Venomous Yaksha was a rosy-cheeked hero, a woman who
      was as strong as a man. The victims who died at her hands were either corrupted
      officials or evil nouveau riche. There were even more extreme versions. In
      these stories, she either had magical abilities to fly up high or move underground
      at will, or that she was a demon emerged from the Land of Origin, with three
      heads and six arms, and the ability to turn into smoke and shadow. Some even
      insisted that The Venomous Yaksha had the appearance of a demon, with a green
      face and giant yellow fangs, and that every part of her body was poisonous:
      Even a drop of her saliva or sweat could kill a man. And that she liked to
      drink flesh blood and drain the vital\r\n\r\nenergy of her victims. They cited
      her victims died of being poisoned by her saliva as she drained their yang
      energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of which versions it was \u2013 ones
      that portrayed her as a hero, or ones that said she was a fiend \u2013, all
      had one thing in common: A hearty laughter, mixed in with the sound of bells
      ringing, to create a haunting and eery sound every time The Venomous Yaksha
      would strike. Like a cat playing with a mouse, all versions of the tales about
      The Venomous Yaksha seemed to say one thing in common: that she liked to torture
      her targets, laughing maniacally as they were dying in excruciating pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps,
      except for the members of the \u0110o\xE0n Clan in Chi\xEAn \u0110\xE0n Village,
      no one else could have guessed the cruel and evil Venomous Yaksha in the stories,
      was just, in fact, a young girl barely becoming of age."
