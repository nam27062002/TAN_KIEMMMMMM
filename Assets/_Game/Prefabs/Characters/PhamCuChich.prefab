    story: "\u201CBefore the country of Nguy\u1EC7t Minh was founded, the lands in
      the south of what is now called the Dead Plains was a country called V\u1EA1n
      S\u01A1n (lit: ten thousand mountains). V\u1EA1n S\u01A1n was not a country
      of humans, but rather one of a race with wings behind their backs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CIn
      V\u1EA1n S\u01A1n, humans were considered goods owned by the winged race, and
      were herded into farms like cattle and horses. This race of people called themselves
      gods, built temples and shrines everywhere, and forced humans to worship them.
      Even today, there are still ruins in Nguy\u1EC7t Minh of these shrines and
      temples. Every time there was an important occasion, these false gods would
      organize brutal and bloody sacrifices. Several times, thousands of people were
      killed in one night, their heads would get piled up into towering mounds and
      fresh blood would turn ponds red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CSix hundred years ago, the
      false gods mobilized twenty thousand slaves to construct a two-story Citadel.
      The Citadel, which shaped like a bird\u2019s nest \u2013 high walls all around
      with a lowered center, took over a century to complete. The upper floor was
      the center of the nest, welcoming warm sunlight and cooling breeze. The false
      god liked it up high, so they used this floor to live. They carried out large-scale
      construction, including a flower garden, lakes and ponds, fake mountains and
      even a planted forest. This was called the Upper City. The Lower City was the
      parts below the bird\u2019s nest, confined and stuffy. Once the Citadel\u2019s
      gate was closed, it was almost completely sealed off. Humans were forced to
      live in the Lower City, and only saw sunlight when they were out farming all
      years round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThree hundred years ago, a fisherman escaped
      into the White Ash Desert and was met with a goddess decending onto Earth.
      Together, they raised an army called the Army of Nightfall and came back to
      launch a siege on Thi\xEAn \u0110\xF4 Citadel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Nation
      of V\u1EA1n S\u01A1n fell, and the fisherman accepted the mandate of the Heaven.
      He founded the country of Nguy\u1EC7t Minh in Thi\xEAn \u0110\xF4 Citadel,
      and proclaimed himself as the Obsidian Emperor. The new Emperor dethroned the
      false gods, labeled their entire race \u2013 the Winged Ones \u2013 as criminals,
      and issued a \u201CWings Severing\u201D Decree. Men of this criminal race\r\n\r\nhad
      their wings cut off before being forced into labors, while women of their race
      had their wrists\u2019 and ankles\u2019 tendons severed and kept as court dancers
      or given to court officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Obsidian Emperor then had
      eight holes drilled onto the floor of the Upper City, naming them the Dragon
      Eye Wells. He then commisioned wooden ladders operated by pulleys at the edges
      of the wells, naming them the Heavenly Bridge. From then on, the Lower City
      can finally see sunlight, and also the opportunity to ascend to the Upper City
      via the Heavenly Bridge.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nPh\u1EA1m C\u1EF1 Ch\xEDch closed
      the history book in front of him. Every time he read to the part about the
      Obsidian Emperor raising his army for the seige, his back would ache. He sighed
      and looked to the edge of the table, where there was a token representing his
      current status and identity: the leader of the Forest Sect of Vong.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
      the tingling pain on his back slowly receeded."
