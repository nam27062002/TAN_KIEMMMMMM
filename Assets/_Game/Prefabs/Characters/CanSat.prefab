    story: "She glided past.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be night then, as she didn\u2019t
      feel the burning pain all over her body. The air was filled with a familiar
      fishy odor and pungent heat. It reminded her of fragmented and broken distant
      memories.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe remembered the fire. She remebered the melodious sounds,
      sometimes low, sometimes high \u2013 completely different from the screams,
      cries, and curses that she had gotten used to. The fire flickered, projected
      on the wall in her memories were a shadow of someone. A young woman, with long
      hair reaching all the way to her waist. The hem of her dress swirled, gracefully,
      sometimes revealing, sometimes covering up, as she danced. She remembered the
      men. How many were there? She couldn\u2019t tell anymore. The faces after the
      hundredth all gradually become the same, blended together. But she remebered
      the look in their eyes. They were full of a wild, lustful desire to conquer.
      Now, she could no longer tell how people look at her, but she could guess there
      were no longer any lust nor desire. Perhaps, now there was only disgust. Because
      now, now people called her C\xE0n S\xE1t.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memories changed.
      The lustful gazes were filled with fear. Deep in their eyes, she could see
      a belated understanding. They \u2013 the men, her targets \u2013 had finally
      recognized the poison that was spreading through their veins. She remembered\u2026
      yes, she seemed to be smiling back then. How could they have discovered her
      trick when the poison itself was divided into two. Half was in the wine. The
      other was in her lipstick. The higher the fire of lust burned, the faster the
      poison spread. How could she not smile at that?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe memories shifted
      again. This time, there was another woman in front of her, holding a child
      in diapers. The other woman was haggart, with eyes dulled by hunger. She was
      looking up at her, with pleading eyes. Her arms were outstretched, trembling.
      Her nails were peeled, covered in dirt and blood. But she still held the baby
      so steadily. It was so light\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nShe remembered taking the baby\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nBroken
      phrases, unfinished thoughts\u2026 all came rushing back along with the warmth
      of the newborn baby in her arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201COne last mission.\u201D \u201CThe
      god with three faces.\u201D \u201CAssassination of the emperor.\u201D \u201CA
      small tavern in the countryside.\u201D Back then, holding the baby in her arms,
      perhaps she had also thought of a different future. An adopted child, maybe?
      Or just a cover? She could no longer remember clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut she did
      remember\u2026 that she had failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baby\u2019s shrill cries,
      the mocking laughter of the Emperor\u2019s Guards. It seemed that, mixed in,
      were the voices of her victims, gloating. She had been too confident. Hundreds
      of victims\u2019 faces had made her arrogant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CLet\u2019s see
      here. What if I sew your eyes shut? Will you be able to come back to haunt
      me after death?\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201CMan, let\u2019s sew her mouth shut too!
      Otherwise, she\u2019ll go down there and sue us to the Chakravartin King, and
      we\u2019ll be in serious trouble!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst her eyelids were sewn
      shut. Then her mouth. The cold sensation of the rusty needle piercing her flesh
      kept stopping and starting. She seemed to have passed out several times. And
      the last sound she ever heard before everything became hazy was the child\u2019s
      muffled cry.\r\n\r\n\r\nC\xE0n S\xE1t let go. Something small just fell to
      her feet. Soft and cold. All her broken memories disappeared. She stood there
      in a daze, not knowing what she was doing, or what she wanted to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter
      a long while, C\xE0n S\xE1t continued to wander, searching for the warmth that
      had \u2013 once again \u2013 just slipped away."
