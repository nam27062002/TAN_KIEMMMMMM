    story: "The late emperor Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng was a tyrannical and brutal ruler.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording
      to the Palace Guards, he\u2019d been bloodthirsty since he was a child \u2013
      that it was inborn and not learnt from anyone. They said that many times while
      patrolling, they\u2019ve peeked inside out of curiosity, to find that the prince\u2019s
      palace was no different from Hell. Emperor Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng \u2013 or rather,
      Prince H\u1EA1o at the time \u2013 sat high on his bed, and in front of him,
      down on the ground, were the Palace Maids being whipped. The whip \u2013 made
      from the tail of a stingray \u2013 had sharp spikes, so any contact was enough
      to draw blood. Prince H\u1EA1o was reportedly overjoy at the scene of fresh
      blood splattered everywhere, clapping his hands together and laughing loudly.
      Sometimes, in the middle of the night, he could aledgedly even be seen, in
      pajamas, crawling and licking blood off the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, as the
      Thi\xEAn \u0110\xF4 Citadel fell into chaos, the Royal family was scattered.
      It was then that Prince H\u1EA1o borrowed the Tr\u1EA7n Army to attack the
      old cappital. He beheaded all of his brothers, imprisoned his own biological
      father, and then sat on the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Prince H\u1EA1o
      massacred at will. In the battle of B\u1ED3 Hao, a hundred and thirty thousands
      people surrendered and were all killed. Their bodies made up a small mound.
      In the\r\n\r\nbattle of Ho\xE0i L\xE2m, he flooded the city, killing over ten
      thousand households. The river was reportedly so filled with corpse its flow
      was disrupted. In the battle of Ba S\u01A1n, he set up an ambush for General
      T\xF4 D\u1EF1, then sent troops to rob supplies, resulting in eighty thousands
      civilians starving to death on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter two years on the
      throne, Emperor Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng still had no prince. Suspecting it to be
      divine retribution, twenty years ago, the emperor went to B\xE1t Tr\u1EE5 temple
      to pray to the gods for a son. Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed across
      the sky. The Emperor took that as the gods answering his prayers, so he bowed
      his head in thanks. Not long after he returned to the Palace, a royal concubine
      became pregnant, surprising every officials in court. Nine months and ten days
      later, a foul smell filled the Palace, as Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng\u2019s concubine
      gave birth to an abominable blob of flesh. It had eight legs, ten arms, six
      mouths, twenty-seven eyes, four noses and ten mouths. The blob did not cry
      or fuss when it was born. Instead, it cursed that the L\xFD Dynasty would end
      with Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng having no more descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurious, Emperor
      Th\u1EA7n T\xF4ng ordered for the blob of flesh to be thrown into the river,
      and forbid all who knew from ever mentioning it to anyone else. The abominable
      blob drifted down stream and washed up shore at Mai Hoa Village \u2013 the
      L\xFD ancestral homeland. Villagers here were told by it in their dreams about
      the whole thing, so they understood that the L\xFD Dynasty was inhumane and
      had been punished by the heaven. As such, they brought the blob of flesh back
      to bury and enshrined it in a temple. Even nowadays, there is still the tradition
      of holding a festival there every year to commemorate the day the blob of flesh
      was retrieved from the river, called the Man-Urchin Procession.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt
      from \u201CExotic tales from The Heavenly Capital.\u201D \u2013 Volume 8."
