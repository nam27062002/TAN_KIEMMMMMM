    story: "Recently, around Thi\xEAn \u0110\xF4 Citadel (the Heavenly Capital),
      there was an uproar over the death of a healer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the bloody
      murder took place, people used to see him drunken in taverns, rambling on and
      on about some old tales that everyone but the children has heard too many times
      already.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story he told seemed to change every time he\u2019d
      told them. Maybe it was just the nonsensical rambling of a drunkard, or maybe
      there was some hidden agenda behind these changes that no one knew about, but
      a few key points seem to remain unchanged:\r\n\r\n\r\nLike while the Moonlit
      Marrygold flower appeared pretty with \u201Cpetals like liquid silver and pistil
      like pure gold\u201D, its greatest value lie in its medicinal properties. This
      flower can be used as a cure for leprosy, and it would only take a few doses
      to completely cure the disease in a matter of days. But the rich of the capital
      only liked it for its beautiful and money-like appearance. They bought all
      of them up just for selfish enjoyment, and thus inflating its price through
      the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, the herbalist said it was because of sympathy
      for the patients, others because he was dissatisfied with the officials, but
      the outcome was always the same. Three years ago, he followed a flower-picking
      group all the way to White Ash Desert \u2013 where instead of golden sands
      were mounds and fields of white ashes as far as the eyes could see \u2013 to
      seek these flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entire group was attacked by a group of
      monsters, and in the end, only the doctor returned alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monsters
      in his story \u2013 which the healer called Steelborn \u2013 were a group of
      ferrocious and savage monstrocity. They had no skin, large bulging eyes, wheels
      growing out of their legs, and\r\n\r\nred fleshy tentacles for arms. These
      descriptions were so ridiculous that no one believed him \u2013 not even the
      children, but the herbalist didn\u2019t seem to care. He kept saying the truth
      is the truth, and that people will eventually have to change their views of
      him, as well as his story of the Steelborn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, before anyone
      realizes it, paintings of the \u201CSteelborn\u201D species as described by
      the healer surfaced all over the streets and marketplaces. Adults found the
      image strange and haunting, so they bought them to bring home and scare naughty
      children into behaving, thus making these paintings popular.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few
      days before his death, the herbalist began to assert that the desert monsters
      known as Steelborn were actually the ghosts of the people died from leprosy.
      Citing the lack of skin and the deformed limbs as his proofs and reasonings.
      As this rumor began to spread, the rich and royalty could no longer seek the
      Moonlit Marrygold, while the merchants had no choice but to sell off to pharmacies
      to make up for losses. This news greatly pleased the healer. He wore new clothes
      to the Star Viewing Festival, and walked around the village like a hero. Perhaps,
      in his mind, he really thought he had done something remarkable. Every time
      he would walk pass the leper colony and see the paintings of the Steelborn
      plastered on the wall, people would see the herbalist try to hide a smile.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
      his happy days were short lived before people found him drunk and stabbed to
      death in a deserted alley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officials only orders an investigation
      out of formality, to reassured everyone, and then left it at that. The Moonlit
      Marrygold once again made a comeback to the marketplace, being sold to nobles
      at the same old price. The merchants built a large tomb for the herbalist,
      and errected a statue to worship him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the Capital
      were hardly surprised by the death of the healer, only curious as to who was
      it that got to him in the end? Was it the officials? The nobles? Other doctors?
      Or the merchants?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, the lepers were the happiest out of all
      this. People walking passed have reportedly heard them talking to each other,
      celebrating the fact that, from then on, no one would make up stories to slander
      them anymore."
